Hey guys,Eric here! I'm a Chinese student currently studying in Zhejiang University. My major is agricultural and Biosystems engineering, and I also have a minor in ACEE(Advanced Class of Engineering Education).

As a fervent technology learner and future engineer, it is my wish to create my own website to share my knowledge and communicate with extraordinary developers worldwide!

In the future, I will continue perfecting this site and implant new functions!
